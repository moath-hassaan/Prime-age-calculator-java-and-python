For Windows

Download the JDK installer for Windows from the official Oracle website: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html

      - Open System Properties (Right click Computer in the start menu, or use the keyboard shortcut Win+Pause)
      - Click Advanced system settings
      - Click Environment Variables
      - Under System Variables, find the Path variable, select it, and click Edit.
      - In the Edit dialog, click New and add the path to the JDK installed directory's bin folder (e.g., C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-11\bin)

    You can verify the installation by opening a new Command Prompt and typing java -version. If the installation was successful, you will see the version of your JDK.
    
    
    For Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)

    Open a terminal window.

    Update the package index: sudo apt update

    Install the JDK with the following command: sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk

    You can verify the installation by typing java -version in the terminal. If the installation was successful, you will see the version of your JDK.
